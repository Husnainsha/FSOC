COMPARISON ANALYSIS OF LOG-NORMAL, GAMMA-GAMMA AND EXPONENTIATED WEIBULL FADING MODEL FOR FREE SPACE TERRESTRIAL LINK

Abstract

In Free-space optical communication, the received signal envelope is affected by various impairments. The most dominating effect is turbulence-induced fading. To model this turbulence there are various fading channel models such as log-normal. In this thesis, the accuracy of log-normal, gamma-gamma and Exponentiated Weibull model is compared under varying conditions of link distance, wavelength and different aperture sizes. It has been observed that by increasing the link distance, decreasing wavelength and decreasing aperture size the variance of irradiance intensity increases and results in the reduced accuracy of these models. Moreover, the results of Exponentiated Weibull, log-normal and gamma-gamma fading are analyzed with the experimental data which show that the EW fading model presents the better fit for data under different aperture averaging conditions.
